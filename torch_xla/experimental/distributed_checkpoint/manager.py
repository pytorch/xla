class CheckpointManager:
  """
  The CheckpointManager class provides a higher-level wrapper around the
  torch.distributed.checkpoint APIs to manage checkpointing. It builds on top
  of those APIs to enable a few key features:
    - Per-step checkpointing: Each checkpoint taken by the CheckpointManager is
          identified by the step at which it was taken, and any step tracked
          by the CheckpointManager can be restored.
    - Async checkpointing: The torch.distributed.checkpoint APIs are
          synchronous, which will block training for the duration of the
          checkpoint. The CheckpointManager's save_async method can be used to
          offload checkpointing to a background thread, unblocking training
          while the checkpoint is written to persistent storage.
    - Automatic checkpointing: If the training process would be shut down due
          to a SIGTERM, the CheckpointManager will automatically take a
          checkpoint at the next step.
    - Native fsspec integration: Any storage protocol compatible with fsspec
          can be used with CheckpointManager.
  
  The intended usage of CheckpointManager is as follows:

  >>> # Create a CheckpointManager to checkpoint every 10 steps into GCS.
  >>> chkpt_mgr = CheckpointManager('gs://my-bucket/my-experiment', 10)
  
  >>> # Select a checkpoint to restore from, and restore if applicable
  >>> tracked_steps = chkpt_mgr.all_steps()
  >>> if tracked_steps:
  >>>   # Choose the highest step
  >>>   best_step = max(tracked_steps)
  >>>   state_dict = {'model': model.state_dict()}
  >>>   chkpt_mgr.restore(best_step, state_dict)
  >>>   model.load_state_dict(state_dict['model'])

  >>> # Call `save` or `save_async` every step within the train loop.
  >>> for step, data in enumerate(dataloader):
  >>>   ...
  >>>   state_dict = {'model': model.state_dict(), 'optim': optim.state_dict()}
  >>>   if chkpt_mgr.save_async(step, state_dict):
  >>>     print(f'Checkpoint taken at step {step}')

  By calling `save` or `save_async` every step, the CheckpointManager has the
  opportunity to take a checkpoint on steps which are out-of-cycle with its
  step_period, as would be the case in auto checkpointing.

  This class is inspired by Orbax's CheckpointManager, which can be found here:
