      Given logical parallelism axes with sizes in `mesh_shape` and devices in an
      N-dimensional torus network represented by `physical_mesh`, maps each logical
      axis to one or more physical axes. Prefer to map more-performance-sensitive
      logical axes to larger numbers of physical axes to maximize the bandwidth
      available to them. Also prefer to assign logical axes to multiple physical
      axes of the same size (e.g., a 2D square) rather than multiple physical axes
      of different sizes when possible.

      Note that this routine will never split a physical axis over more than one
      logical axis (which would reduce total usable bandwidth but may sometimes be
      desired anyway). As a result, it will error out in cases where this is
      necessary to produce a valid mapping.

      Let's use a concrete example to explain the concepts and considerations.

      As an example, suppose the logical mesh is [data, model], for data and model
      parallelism respectively. Also suppose that data parallelism is less
      performance sensitive than model parallelism. Consider a 3D TPU pod slice of
      shape 4x4x16, represented by a physical mesh of shape (4, 4, 16).

      A TPU pod slice has equal bandwidth along all axes with wraparound links, but
      a 2D plane of size 4x4 may have faster XLA collective implementations than a
      non-square plane or a 1D subgroup. If the mesh_shape is [16, 16], we may want
      the more performance sensitive `model` axis to be mapped to the 4x4 XY plane.
