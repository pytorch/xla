# Performance guideline for running on TPUs

## XLA tensors

PyTorch/XLA adds a new device, similarly to CPU and GPU devices. The following snippet creates an XLA tensor filled with random values, then prints the device and the contents of the tensor:

```python
import torch
import torch_xla
import torch_xla_py.xla_model as xm

x = torch.randn(4, 2, device=xm.xla_device())
print(x.device)
print(x)
```

The XLA device is not a physical device but instead stands in for either a Cloud TPU or CPU. The underlying storage for XLA tensors is a contiguous buffer in device memory and the code in the model shouldn't assume any stride.

XLA Tensor doesn't support converting single tensor to half precision using `tensor.half()`. Instead, environment variable `XLA_USE_BF16` is available, which converts **all** PyTorch float values to bfloat16 when sending them to the TPU device. The conversion is totally transparent to the user, and the XLA tensors will still retain a float dtype. Similarly, when the tensor is moved back to CPU, its type will be float.

The [XLA readme](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/README.md) describes all the options available to run on TPU or CPU.

## Running a model

There are different ways to run a model using the PyTorch/XLA framework.

### Native PyTorch API

The simplest (but not good performing) one is to just run on one core and send the input tensors to the XLA devices manually:

```python
import torch_xla_py.xla_model as xm

device = xm.xla_device()
model = MNIST()
loss_fn = nn.NLLLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr, momentum=momentum)

model.train()
for data, target in train_loader:
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  data = data.to(device)
  target = target.to(device)
  output = model(data)
  loss = loss_fn(output, target)
  loss.backward()
  xm.optimizer_step(optimizer, barrier=True)
```

The above is only running on one TPU core though, and the time spent to send data to device is serial/inline with the TPU computation.
For simple experiments, or for inference tasks which are not latency-sensitive it might be still OK, but the following methods allow for better scalability.

Note the `xm.optimizer_step(optimizer, barrier=True)` line which replaces the usual
`optimizer.step()`. This is required because of the way XLA tensors work:
operations are not executed immediately, but rather added to a graph of pending
operations which is only executed when its results are required. Using
`xm.optimizer_step(optimizer, barrier=True)` acts as an execution barrier which forces the
evaluation of the graph accumulated for a single step. Without this barrier, the
graph would only be evaluated when evaluating the accuracy of the model, which
is only done at the end of an epoch, for this example. Even for small models,
the accumulated graph would be too big to evaluate at the end of an entire
epoch.

### MultiCore

There are two ways to drive multiple TPU cores using PyTorch/XLA. One is using the `torch.multiprocessing` module (which internally spawns multiple processes), and the other is using Python threading.
The multiprocessing method should allow better performance as it gets around the Python GIL serialization, especially with model code which has a heavy Python side processing.
Note that in the MultiCore setting, a barrier is included inside the data
iterators, so there are no explicit `barrier=True` in the examples below.

#### MultiCore - MultiProcessing

Code for multiprocessing looks like:

```python
import torch_xla_py.xla_model as xm
import torch_xla_py.xla_multiprocessing as xmp

def _mp_fn(index):
  device = xm.xla_device()
  para_loader = dp.ParallelLoader(train_loader, [device])
  
  model = MNIST()
  loss_fn = nn.NLLLoss()
  optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr, momentum=momentum)

  model.train()
  for data, target in para_loader.per_device_loader(device):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    xm.optimizer_step(optimizer)
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
  xmp.spawn(_mp_fn, args=())
```

One thing to remember about the multiprocessing approach is that `torch.multiprocessing` uses the `spawn` method of Python multiprocessing, which spawns completely new processes (contrary to forking) and send pickled data over pipes.
The only data which is pickled is that data passed to the target function of the `xmp.spawn()` API (the `args` argument), so if the parent process changes the global state before calling `xmp.spawn()`, such data won't be reflected into the child processes (unless passed into `args`).

Check the [full example](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/test/test_train_mp_mnist.py) showing how to train MNIST on TPU using multiprocesing.

#### MultiCore - MultiThreading

To run a model using the Python threading support (embedded within the `torch_xla_py.data_parallel.DataParallel` interface), use the following API:

```python
import torch_xla_py.xla_model as xm
import torch_xla_py.data_parallel as dp

devices = xm.get_xla_supported_devices()
model_parallel = dp.DataParallel(MNIST, device_ids=devices)

def train_loop_fn(model, loader, device, context):
  loss_fn = nn.NLLLoss()
  optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr, momentum=momentum)

  model.train()
  for _, (data, target) in loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    xm.optimizer_step(optimizer)

for epoch in range(1, num_epochs + 1):
  model_parallel(train_loop_fn, train_loader)
```

The same multi-core API can be used to run on a single core as well by setting the device_ids argument to the selected core. Passing `[]` as `device_ids` causes the model to run using the PyTorch native CPU support.

Check the [full example](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/test/test_train_mnist.py) showing how to train MNIST on TPU using `torch_xla_py.data_parallel.DataParallel` (Python threading).

## Performance caveats

PyTorch/XLA behaves semantically like regular PyTorch and XLA tensors, implementing the full tensor interface. However, constraints in XLA and hardware, and the lazy evaluation model mean some patterns must be avoided:

1.  Tensor shapes should be the same between iterations, or a low number of shape variations should be used. PyTorch/XLA automatically recompiles the graph every time new shapes are encountered. This means that, if the shapes don’t stabilize during training, more time will be spent compiling than running the model. Pad tensors to fixed sizes when possible. Direct or indirect uses of `nonzero` introduce dynamic shapes; for example, masked indexing `base[index]` where `index` is a mask tensor.
1.  Certain operations don’t have native translations to XLA and therefore require transfer to the CPU memory, evaluation on CPU, and transfer of the result back to the XLA device. This is automatically handled by PyTorch/XLA, but doing too many such operations during the training step can lead to significant slowdowns. The `item()` operation is one such example and it is used in [clip_grad_norm_](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/de19eeee99a2a282fc441f637b23d8e50c75ecd1/torch/nn/utils/clip_grad.py#L33). Below is an alternative implementation which avoids the need for `item()`:

    ```python
    ...
    else:
      device = parameters[0].device
      total_norm = torch.zeros([], device=device if parameters else None)
      for p in parameters:
        param_norm = p.grad.data.norm(norm_type) ** norm_type
        total_norm.add_(param_norm)
      total_norm = (total_norm ** (1. / norm_type))
    clip_coef = torch.tensor(max_norm, device=device) / (total_norm + 1e-6)
    for p in parameters:
      p.grad.data.mul_(torch.where(clip_coef < 1, clip_coef, torch.tensor(1., device=device)))
    ```


1. In order to avoid recompilations, not only shapes must be constant, but also computations accross XLA devices in all hosts. A special case of this is loops with a different number of iterations between steps. PyTorch/XLA automatically handles them, but they are seen as different execution graphs and require recompilations.

1. Iterators in `torch_xla_py.data_parallel` may drop the
last few batches in the input iterator, in order to do the same amount of work
on all XLA devices. In the extreme case where dataset is small, and there are
too few steps, this may result in a no-op epoch. Therefore, it is better to use
small batch sizes in those cases.

1. Even when it's known that a PyTorch tensor is a scalar, avoid using
   `tensor.item()`. Prefer instead keeping it as a tensor and the use of tensor
   operations on it, using control flow substitutes such as `torch.where`.
   Following the latter approach will likely result in those operations behind
   fully fused within an XLA graph, without the need of issuing separate TPU
   computations. This can dramatically improve performance of the model, up to
   an N factor, where N is the number of `tensor.item()` calls per step.

`print(torch_xla._XLAC._xla_metrics_report())` can be used to print metrics at the end of each step to collect information regarding the number of compilations and operators that are part of the model but don’t have native XLA implementations. The `XLA_METRICS_FILE=/PATH/TO/FILE` environment setting can also be used to export per step metrics to a file.

In this report, any counter that starts with `aten::`
indicates a context switch between the XLA device and CPU, which can be a
potential performance optimization area in the model code.
