        "* Install PyTorch/XLA on Colab, which lets you use PyTorch with TPUs.\n",
        "* Run basic PyTorch functions on TPUs, like creating and adding tensors.\n",

The PyTorch/XLA team would love to hear your ideas/suggestions/comments, too! For now, the best way to contact the team is with an issue on our Github: https://github.com/pytorch/xla/issues. \n",
