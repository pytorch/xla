# Colab Notebooks

The following are a couple of sample colab notebooks.

## Get started with our Colab Tutorials
* [Fast Neural Style Transfer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/style_transfer_inference.ipynb)
* [Training MNIST on TPUs](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/mnist-training.ipynb)
* [Training ResNet18 on TPUs with Cifar10 dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/resnet18-training.ipynb)
* [Inference with Pretrained ResNet50 Model](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/resnet18-training.ipynb)

*Note*: These colab notebooks typically run on small machines (the Compute VMs,
which runs the input pipeline) and training is often bottlenecked on the small
Compute VM machines. For optimal performance create a GCP VM and TPU pair
following our GCP Tutorials:
* [Training FairSeq Transformer on Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/transformer-pytorch)
* [Training Resnet50 on Cloud TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/resnet-alpha-py)
* [Training PyTorch models on Cloud TPU Pods](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/tutorials/pytorch-pod)
