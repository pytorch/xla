        "- Run the map function using `spawn`.\n",

        "Additional notebooks demonstrating how to run PyTorch on Cloud TPUs can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/xla). While Colab provides a free Cloud TPU, training is even faster on [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/pytorch/xla#Cloud), especially when using multiple Cloud TPUs in a Cloud TPU pod. Scaling from a single Cloud TPU, like in this notebook, to many Cloud TPUs in a pod is easy, too. You use the same code as this notebook and just spawn more processes."
