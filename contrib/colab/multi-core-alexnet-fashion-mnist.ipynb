    "This notebook will show you how to train [AlexNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997) on the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) using a Cloud TPU and all eight of its cores. It's a follow-up to [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/single-core-alexnet-fashion-mnist.ipynb), which trains the same network on the same dataset the using a single Cloud TPU core.

    "This notebook broke down training AlexNet on the Fashion MNIST dataset using an entire Cloud TPU. A [previous notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/xla/blob/master/contrib/colab/single-core-alexnet-fashion-mnist.ipynb) showed how to train AlexNet on Fashion MNIST using only a single Cloud TPU core, and can be a helpful point of comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, this notebook showed us how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define a \"map function\" that runs in parallel on one process per Cloud TPU core. \n",
    "- Run the map function using `spawn`.\n",
    "- Understand the Cloud TPU context, its benefits, like automatic cross-process coordination, and its limits, like needing each process to perform the same Cloud TPU operations.\n",
    "- Load and sample the datasets.\n",
    "- Train and evaluate the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional notebooks demonstrating how to run PyTorch on Cloud TPUs can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/xla). While Colab provides a free Cloud TPU, training is even faster on [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/pytorch/xla#Cloud), especially when using multiple Cloud TPUs in a Cloud TPU pod. Scaling from a single Cloud TPU, like in this notebook, to many Cloud TPUs in a pod is easy, too. You use the same code as this notebook and just spawn more processes."
