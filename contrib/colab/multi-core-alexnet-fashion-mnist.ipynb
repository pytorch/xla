        "- Define a \"map function\" that runs in parallel on one process per Cloud TPU core. \n",
        "- Run the map function using `spawn`.\n",
        "- Understand the Cloud TPU context, its benefits, like automatic cross-process coordination, and its limits, like needing each process to perform the same Cloud TPU operations.\n",
        "- Load and sample the datasets.\n",
        "- Train and evaluate the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional notebooks demonstrating how to run PyTorch on Cloud TPUs can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/xla). While Colab provides a free Cloud TPU, training is even faster on [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/pytorch/xla#Cloud), especially when using multiple Cloud TPUs in a Cloud TPU pod. Scaling from a single Cloud TPU, like in this notebook, to many Cloud TPUs in a pod is easy, too. You use the same code as this notebook and just spawn more processes."
