Using a Cloud TPU core as a device required one tweak to our network: instead of calling `optimizer.step()` we called `optimizer_step(optimizer, barrier=True).` In future Colabs we'll see a few other tweaks that will let us maximize PyTorch's performance on Cloud TPUs. The [documentation](http://pytorch.org/xla/) also describes them. \n",

You're encouraged to try PyTorch on Cloud TPUs on both Colab and Google Cloud Platform, too! For Colab, just copy the first code cell in this notebook to start your own.
