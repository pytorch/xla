# PJRT Runtime

PyTorch/XLA has migrated from the TensorFlow-based XRT runtime to the [PJRT
runtime](https://github.com/openxla/xla/tree/main/xla/pjrt)
used by [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

If you encounter a bug with PJRT, please file an issue on GitHub with the
`runtime` tag.

_New features in PyTorch/XLA r2.1_:

* PJRT is stable in PyTorch/XLA r2.1!
* Public runtime APIs have moved from `torch_xla.experimental.pjrt` to
  `torch_xla.runtime`.
  * The `pjrt://` init method has been renamed to `xla://`, and it is registered
    by `torch_xla.distributed.xla_backend`.
  * The previous `torch_xla.experimental.*` names are still available in this
    release for compatibility.
* `torchrun` is now supported when using `init_method='xla://'`.
* New plugins for XPU and Neuron via the PJRT C API.

_New features in PyTorch/XLA r2.0_:

* PJRT will be configured by default if you don't pass in any other runtime
  configuration. If you continue to set XRT configuration (`XRT_TPU_CONFIG`),
  this change has no impact
* New TPU runtime implementation in `libtpu` improves performance by up to 30%.
* New `xm.rendezvous` implementation that scales to thousands of TPU cores
* [experimental] `torch.distributed` support for TPU v2 and v3, including
  `pjrt://` `init_method`
* [experimental] Single-host GPU support in PJRT. Multi-host support coming
  soon!

## TL;DR

* To use the PJRT preview runtime, set the `PJRT_DEVICE` environment variable to
  `CPU`, `TPU`, or `GPU`
* In XRT, all distributed workloads are multiprocess, with one process per
  device. On TPU v2 and v3 in PJRT, workloads are multiprocess and multithreaded
  (4 processes with 2 threads each), so your workload should be thread-safe. See
  [Multithreading on TPU v2/v3](#multithreading-on-tpu-v2v3) and the
  [Multiprocessing section of the API
  guide](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/API_GUIDE.md#running-on-multiple-xla-devices-with-multi-processing)
  for more information. Key differences to keep in mind:
  * To initialize a model in a thread-safe way, either broadcast the parameters
    across replicas after initialization
    (`torch_xla.experimental.pjrt.broadcast_master_param`) or load each
    replica's parameters from a common checkpoint.
  * For other random number generation, use `torch.Generator` where possible.
    The global `torch` RNG is _not_ thread-safe, even if you set the same
    `torch.manual_seed` across replicas.
  * To use `torch.distributed`, import `torch_xla.experimental.pjrt_backend` and
    use the `xla://` `init_method`.
  * These steps are optional for GPU and TPU v4.

Sample diff from XRT to PJRT:

```diff
 import os

 import torch
 import torch.nn as nn
 from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
 import torch.optim as optim
 import torch.distributed as dist
 import torch_xla.core.xla_model as xm
 import torch_xla.distributed.parallel_loader as pl
 import torch_xla.distributed.xla_backend
 import torch_xla.distributed.xla_multiprocessing as xmp
+import torch_xla.runtime as xr


 def _mp_fn(index):
   device = xm.xla_device()
-  dist.init_process_group('xla', rank=xm.get_ordinal(), world_size=xm.xrt_world_size())
+  dist.init_process_group('xla', init_method='xla://')

   torch.manual_seed(42)
   model = nn.Linear(128, 10).to(device)

+  # Optional for TPU v4 and GPU
+  xm.broadcast_master_param(model)
   model = DDP(model, gradient_as_bucket_view=True)

   loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
   optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=.001)

   for i in range(10):
     data, target = torch.randn((128, 128), device=device), torch.randn((128, 10), device=device)

     optimizer.zero_grad()
     output = model(data)
     loss = loss_fn(output, target)
     loss.backward()

     optimizer.step()
     xm.mark_step()

   # Print mean parameters so we can confirm they're the same across replicas
   print([p.mean() for p in model.parameters()])

 if __name__ == '__main__':
-  os.environ['XRT_TPU_CONFIG'] = 'localservice;0;localhost:51011'
-  os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
-  os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12355'

+  # Recommended: set PJRT_DEVICE to your local device type
+  os.environ['PJRT_DEVICE'] = 'TPU'

   xmp.spawn(_mp_fn)
```

## Benefits

* Simple runtime configuration: just set `PJRT_DEVICE` to `TPU`, `CPU`, or `GPU`
  and start using XLA! Or, let PJRT select a device automatically based on your
  environment.
* Improved performance: reduced overhead from gRPC means faster end-to-end
  execution. On TorchBench 2.0, we observed a >35% improvement in training time
  on TPU v4.
* Easy pod execution: just copy your code to each TPU worker, and execute them
  all at the same time with `gcloud compute tpus tpuvm ssh --worker=all`.
* Better scaling: removes [XRT's limitation on parameter
  sizes](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/pull/3920) and supports up to 2048 TPU
  chips.

## Quickstart

To start using PJRT with PyTorch/XLA, all you need to do is set the
`PJRT_DEVICE` environment variable. If you're working on a TPU v2 or v3, keep
reading to learn about the differences between TPU v2 and v3 and v4.

### CPU

On any machine with PyTorch/XLA installed, you can run our MNIST example on CPU
like this:

```
PJRT_DEVICE=CPU python3 xla/test/test_train_mp_mnist.py --fake_data
```

### TPU

To create a new TPU with PyTorch/XLA r2.0 installed:

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm create $USER-pjrt --accelerator-type=v4-8 --version=tpu-vm-v4-pt-2.0 --zone=us-central2-b --project=$PROJECT
```

On a v4-8, you can run our ResNet50 example like this:

```
git clone --depth=1 --branch r2.0 https://github.com/pytorch/xla.git
PJRT_DEVICE=TPU python3 xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data --batch_size=256 --num_epochs=1
```

By default, PJRT will use all TPU chips. To use only one TPU chip, configure
`TPU_PROCESS_BOUNDS` and `TPU_VISIBLE_CHIPS`:

```
TPU_PROCESS_BOUNDS=1,1,1 TPU_VISIBLE_CHIPS=0 PJRT_DEVICE=TPU python3 xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data --batch_size=256 --num_epochs=1
```

#### Pods

On TPU Pods, use `gcloud` to run your command on each TPU in parallel:

```
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $USER-pjrt --zone=us-central2-b --project=$PROJECT --worker=all --command="git clone --depth=1 --branch r1.13 https://github.com/pytorch/xla.git"
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $USER-pjrt --zone=us-central2-b --project=$PROJECT --worker=all --command="PJRT_DEVICE=TPU python3 xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data --batch_size=256 --num_epochs=1"
```

#### Docker

You can also use Docker to run your workload in a container with PyTorch/XLA
preinstalled:

```
export DOCKER_IMAGE=gcr.io/...

# Optional: authenticate docker if your image is in a private GCP repository
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $USER-pjrt --zone=us-central2-b --project=$PROJECT --worker=all --command "sudo gcloud auth configure-docker"

# Run your workload
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $USER-pjrt --zone=us-central2-b --project=$PROJECT --worker=all --command "sudo docker run --rm --privileged --net=host -e PJRT_DEVICE=TPU $DOCKER_IMAGE python pytorch/xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data"
```

Note that `docker run` requires privileged access to the host (`--privileged`)
to expose the TPU device to the container. Docker on TPU pods is only supported
with host networking `--net=host` at this time. See the [Cloud TPU documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/run-in-container)
for more information.

### GPU

*Warning: GPU support is still highly experimental!*

### Single-node GPU training

To use GPUs with PJRT, simply set `PJRT_DEVICE=GPU` and configure
`GPU_NUM_DEVICES` to the number of devices on the host. For example:

```
PJRT_DEVICE=GPU GPU_NUM_DEVICES=4 python3 xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data --batch_size=128 --num_epochs=1
```

You can also use `torchrun` to initiate the single-node multi-GPU training. For example,

```
PJRT_DEVICE=GPU torchrun --nnodes 1 --nproc-per-node ${NUM_GPU_DEVICES} xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data --pjrt_distributed --batch_size=128 --num_epochs=1
```

In the above example, `--nnodes` means how many machines (physical machines or VMs) to be used (it is 1 since we do single-node training). `--nproc-per-node` means how many GPU devices to be used.

### Multi-node GPU training

**Note that this feature only works for cuda 12+**. Similar to how PyTorch uses multi-node training, you can run the command as below:

```
PJRT_DEVICE=GPU torchrun \
--nnodes=${NUMBER_GPU_VM} \
--node_rank=${CURRENT_NODE_RANK} \
--nproc_per_node=${NUMBER_LOCAL_GPU_DEVICES} \
--rdzv_endpoint=<internal_ip_address:port> multinode_training.py
```

- `--nnodes`: how many GPU machines to be used.
- `--node_rank`: the index of the current GPU machines. The value can be 0, 1, ..., ${NUMBER_GPU_VM}-1.
- `--nproc_per_node`: the number of GPU devices to be used on the current machine.
- `--rdzv_endpoint`: the endpoint of the GPU machine with node_rank==0, in the form <host>:<port>. The `host` will be the internal IP address. The port can be any available port on the machine.

For example, if you want to train on 2 GPU machines: machine_0 and machine_1, on the first GPU machine machine_0, run

```
# PJRT_DEVICE=GPU torchrun \
--nnodes=2 \
--node_rank=0 \
--nproc_per_node=4 \
--rdzv_endpoint="<MACHINE_0_IP_ADDRESS>:12355" pytorch/xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py  --fake_data --pjrt_distributed --batch_size=128 --num_epochs=1
```

On the second GPU machine, run

```
# PJRT_DEVICE=GPU torchrun \
--nnodes=2 \
--node_rank=1 \
--nproc_per_node=4 \
--rdzv_endpoint="<MACHINE_0_IP_ADDRESS>:12355" pytorch/xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py  --fake_data --pjrt_distributed --batch_size=128 --num_epochs=1
```

the difference between the 2 commands above are `--node_rank` and potentially `--nproc_per_node` if you want to use different number of GPU devices on each machine. All the rest are identical. For more information about `torchrun`, please refer to this [page](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html).

## Differences from XRT

Although in most cases we expect PJRT and XRT to work mostly interchangeably
from the end-user's perspective (especially on TPU v4), there are some subtle
differences that are important to keep in mind. Importantly, XRT was designed
around the TPU Node architecture, so it will always spawn a client and a server
process, even on TPU VMs. Thus, every batch of inputs has additional latency
from serializing and deserializing data to send it over the network.

PJRT uses the local device directly with no intermediate server process. In the
default configuration, PJRT will create one process per TPU chip, or 4 processes
per TPU host. See the [Cloud TPU
documentation](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm) for
more information about TPU architecture.

* Performance gains are possible for workloads constrained overhead from .
* Under XRT, the server process is the only process that interacts with the TPU
  devices, and client processes don't have direct access to the TPU devices.
  When profiling a single-host TPU (e.g. v3-8 or v4-8), you would normally see 8
  device traces (one for each TPU core). With PJRT, each process has one chip,
  and a profile from that process will show only 2 TPU cores.
  * For the same reason, profiling does not work on TPU Pods with XRT, because
    the server process runs independently from the user's model code. PJRT does
    not have that constraint, so it is possible to profile 2 TPU cores per
    process in a TPU Pod.
* PJRT only supports the TPU VM architecture and we have no plans to support the
  TPU Node architecture with PJRT.
* Runtime configuration is significantly simpler with PJRT. `xla_dist` is not
  required to run TPU Pod workloads. Instead, copy your code to each TPU host
  (`[gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm
  scp](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/compute/tpus/tpu-vm/scp)`)
  and run the code on each host in parallel (e.g. `[gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm
  ssh --workers=all --command="PJRT_DEVICE=TPU python
  run.py"](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/compute/tpus/tpu-vm/ssh)`)
* `xm.rendezvous` has been reimplemented using XLA-native collective
  communication to enhance stability on large TPU pods. See below for more
  details.


### Multithreading on TPU v2/v3

On TPU v2 and v3, **distributed workloads always run multithreaded**, since each
TPU core exposes two TPU cores as devices and only one process may open a TPU
chip at a time. In its default configuration, `xmp.spawn` automatically spawns
as many processes as possible (4 per TPU host) and creates two threads per
process (one per TPU core).

Note: on TPU v4, each TPU chip is represented as one PyTorch device, so
distributed workloads will run across 4 processes, each with only one thread.
This is identical to XRT's behavior.

In most cases, this will not require substantial changes to your existing code.
The main change you will have to make in most cases is to model initialization.
Because `torch`'s global RNG is shared between threads, results will vary
between threads and runs even if you set `torch.manual_seed` to the same value
in every replica. To get consistent parameters between replicas, either use
`torch_xla.experimental.pjrt.broadcast_master_param` to broadcast one replica's
parameters to all other replicas, or load each replica's parameters from a
common checkpoint.


### Changes to xm.rendezvous

_New in PyTorch/XLA r2.0_

With XRT, worker 0 runs a mesh master service, and all processes on all workers
connect to that service over gRPC. In practice, we found that running a single
mesh master process was unreliable on TPU pods with thousands of chips due to
the number of inbound connections to worker 0. A single client process timing
out could cause a failure and force the entire workload to restart.

Thus, we have reimplemented `xm.rendezvous` with native XLA collective
communication, which is much more stable and well-tested on large TPU pods. This
imposes two new constraints compared to the XRT implementation:

* Because the payload has to become part of the XLA graph, `xm.mark_step` is
  called both before and after the data is transferred. Calling `xm.rendezvous`
  in the middle of model code may force an unwanted compilation.
* Because XLA does not permit collective operations to run on a subset of
  workers, all workers must participate in the `rendezvous`.

If you require the old behavior of `xm.rendezvous` (i.e. communicating data
without altering the XLA graph and/or synchronizing a subset of workers),
consider using
[`torch.distributed.barrier`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#torch.distributed.barrier)
or
[`torch.distributed.all_gather_object`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#torch.distributed.all_gather_object)
with a `gloo` process group. If you are also using the `xla` `torch.distributed`
backend, you can use `torch.new_group` to create a `gloo` subgroup. See [this
example](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.html#monitored-barrier)
from the PyTorch documentation. Keep in mind these constraints:

* `torch.distributed` is not fully supported on TPU v2/v3. Only a subset of
  operations with the `xla` backend are implemented, and `gloo` will likely not
  work as expected in a multithreaded context.
* In our experiments, `gloo` does not scale well to thousands of TPU chips, so
  expect this alternative to be less reliable than using `xm.rendezvous` with
  PJRT at large scales.

### PJRT and torch.distributed

_New in PyTorch/XLA r2.0_

When using PJRT with `torch.distributed` and
`[torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/docs/ddp.md)`
we strongly recommend using the new `xla://` `init_method`, which automatically
finds the replica IDs, world size, and master IP by querying the runtime. For
example:

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch_xla.core.xla_model as xm
import torch_xla.distributed.xla_multiprocessing as xmp
from torch_xla.experimental import pjrt

# Required for `xla://` init_method and `xla` backend
import torch_xla.distributed.xla_backend

def _all_gather(index: int):
  # No need to pass in `rank` or `world_size`
  dist.init_process_group('xla', init_method='xla://')

  t = torch.tensor([index], dtype=torch.int32, device=xm.xla_device())
  output = [torch.zeros_like(t) for _ in range(dist.get_world_size())]
  dist.all_gather(output, t)

  xm.mark_step()
  print(output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
  xmp.spawn(_all_gather)
```

Note: Although the `xla://` init_method is not required on TPU v4, it is still
recommended. If you use `env://`, `MASTER_ADDR` must be set to IP host that has
device 0, which is _not_ always worker 0. The `xla://` init_method finds this
IP automatically.

Note: For TPU v2/v3, you still need to import
`torch_xla.experimental.pjrt_backend`, as TPU v2/v3 support in
`torch.distributed` is still experimental.

For more information about using `DistributedDataParallel` on PyTorch/XLA, see
[`ddp.md`](./ddp.md) on TPU V4. For an example that uses DDP and PJRT together,
run the following [example script](../test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py) on a TPU:

```
PJRT_DEVICE=TPU python xla/test/test_train_mp_mnist.py --ddp --pjrt_distributed --fake_data --num_epochs 1
```

## Performance

TorchBench shows improvements in average training time across tasks with PJRT
compared to XRT, with an average improvement of over 35% on TPU v4-8. The
benefits vary significantly by task and model type, ranging from 0% to 175%.
The following chart shows the breakdown by task:

![PJRT vs XRT](assets/torchbench_pjrt_vs_xrt.svg)

### New TPU runtime

_New in PyTorch/XLA r2.0_

The PyTorch/XLA r2.0 release introduces support for the [PJRT Plugin
API](https://github.com/openxla/community/blob/main/rfcs/20230123-pjrt-plugin.md#rfc-openxla-pjrt-plugin),
used to access the new TFRT-based TPU runtime in `libtpu`. This is now the
default runtime when `PJRT_DEVICE=TPU` is set. The legacy StreamExecutor-based
TPU runtime used in 1.13 will still be available with `PJRT_DEVICE=TPU_LEGACY`
in the 2.0 release, but it will be removed in a future version. If you encounter
an issue that only happens on `TPU` and not `TPU_LEGACY`, please file an issue
on GitHub.

In most cases, we expect performance to be similar between the two runtimes, but
in some cases, the new runtime may be up to 30% faster. The following chart
shows the breakdown by task:

![TFRT vs StreamExecutor](assets/torchbench_tfrt_vs_se.svg)

Note: the improvements shown in this chart are also included in the PJRT vs XRT
comparison.
