# Troubleshoot

Note that the information in this section is subject to be removed in
future releases of the *PyTorch/XLA* software, since many of them are
peculiar to a given internal implementation which might change.

## Sanity Check

Before performing any in depth debugging, we want to do a sanity check
on the installed PyTorch/XLA.

### Check PyTorch/XLA Version

PyTorch and PyTorch/XLA version should match. Check out our
[README](https://github.com/pytorch/xla#getting-started) for more
detials on versions available.

``` sh
vm:~$ python
>>> import torch
>>> import torch_xla
>>> print(torch.__version__)
2.1.0+cu121
>>> print(torch_xla.__version__)
2.1.0
```

### Perform A Simple Calculation

``` sh
vm:~$ export PJRT_DEVICE=TPU
vm:~$ python3
>>> import torch
>>> import torch_xla.core.xla_model as xm
>>> t1 = torch.tensor(100, device=xm.xla_device())
>>> t2 = torch.tensor(200, device=xm.xla_device())
>>> print(t1 + t2)
tensor(300, device='xla:0')
```

### Run Resnet With Fake Data

For nightly

``` sh
vm:~$ git clone https://github.com/pytorch/xla.git
vm:~$ python xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data
```

For release version `x.y`, you want to use the branch `rx.y`. For
example if you installed 2.1 release, you should do

``` sh
vm:~$ git clone --branch r2.1 https://github.com/pytorch/xla.git
vm:~$ python xla/test/test_train_mp_imagenet.py --fake_data
```

If you can get the resnet to run we can conclude that torch_xla is
installed correctly.

## Performance Debugging

To diagnose performance issues, we can use the execution metrics and
counters provided by *PyTorch/XLA* The **first thing** to check when
model is slow is to generate a metrics report.

Metrics report is extremely helpful in diagnosing issues. Please try to
include it in your bug report sent to us if you have it.

## PyTorch/XLA Debugging Tool

You can enable the PyTorch/XLA debugging tool by setting
`PT_XLA_DEBUG_LEVEL=2`, which provides a couple useful debugging
features. You can also lower the debug level to `1` to slip the
execution analysis.

### Perform A Auto-Metrics Analysis

The debugging tool will analyze the metrics report and provide a
summary. Some example output would be

``` sh
pt-xla-profiler: CompileTime too frequent: 21 counts during 11 steps
pt-xla-profiler: TransferFromDeviceTime too frequent: 11 counts during 11 steps
pt-xla-profiler: Op(s) not lowered: aten::_ctc_loss, aten::_ctc_loss_backward,  Please open a GitHub issue with the above op lowering requests.
pt-xla-profiler: CompileTime too frequent: 23 counts during 12 steps
pt-xla-profiler: TransferFromDeviceTime too frequent: 12 counts during 12 steps
```

### Compilation & Execution Analysis

The debugging tool will analyze every compilation and execution for your
model. Some example output would be:

``` sh

```

Some common causes of Compilation/Executation are 1. User manually call
`mark_step`. 2. [Parallel
loader](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/fe4af0080af07f78ca2b614dd91b71885a3bbbb8/torch_xla/distributed/parallel_loader.py#L49-L51)
call `mark_step` for every x (configurable) batch. 3. Exiting a
[profiler StepTrace
region](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/fe4af0080af07f78ca2b614dd91b71885a3bbbb8/torch_xla/debug/profiler.py#L165-L171).
4. Dynamo decide to compile/execute the graph. 5. User trying to
access(often due to logging) the value of a tensor before the
`mark_step`.

The executation caused by 1-4 are expected, and we want to avoid 5 by
either reduce the frequency of accessing tensor values or manually add a
`mark_step` before accessing.

Users should expect to see this `Compilation Cause` +
`Executation Cause` pairs for first couple steps. After the model
stabilize users should expect to only see `Execution Cause`(you can
disable execution analysis by `PT_XLA_DEBUG_LEVEL=1`). To use
PyTorch/XLA efficiently, we expect the same models code to be run for
every step and compilation only happen once for every graph. If you keep
seeing `Compilation Cause`, you should try to dump the IR/HLO following
[this section](#common-debugging-environment-variables-combinations) and
compare the graphs for each step and understand the source of the
differences.

Following section will explain how to get and understand a more detail
metrics report.

## Get A Metrics Report

Put the following line in your program to generate a report:

``` python
import torch_xla.debug.metrics as met

# For short report that only contains a few key metrics.
print(met.short_metrics_report())
# For full report that includes all metrics.
print(met.metrics_report())
```

## Understand The Metrics Report

The report includes things like: - how many time we issue *XLA*
compilations and time spent on issuing. - how many times we execute and
time spent on execution - how many device data handles we create/destroy
etc.

This information is reported in terms of percentiles of the samples. An
example is:

``` sh
Metric: CompileTime
  TotalSamples: 202
  Counter: 06m09s401ms746.001us
  ValueRate: 778ms572.062us / second
  Rate: 0.425201 / second
  Percentiles: 1%=001ms32.778us; 5%=001ms61.283us; 10%=001ms79.236us; 20%=001ms110.973us; 50%=001ms228.773us; 80%=001ms339.183us; 90%=001ms434.305us; 95%=002ms921.063us; 99%=21s102ms853.173us
```

We also provide counters, which are named integer variables which track
internal software status. For example:

``` sh
Counter: CachedSyncTensors
  Value: 395
```

In this report, any counter that starts with `aten::` indicates a
context switch between the XLA device and CPU, which can be a potential
performance optimization area in the model code.

Counters are useful to understand which operations are routed back to
the CPU engine of *PyTorch*. They are fully qualified with their C++
namespace:

    Counter: aten::nonzero
      Value: 33

If you see `aten::` ops other than `nonzero` and `_local_scalar_dense`,
that usually means a missing lowering in PyTorch/XLA. Feel free to open
a feature request for it on [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/issues).

## Clear The Metrics Report

If you want to clear the metrics between steps/epochs, you can use

``` python
import torch_xla.debug.metrics as met

met.clear_all()
```

## PyTorch/XLA + Dynamo Debugging Tool

You can enable the PyTorch/XLA + Dynamo debugging tool by setting
`XLA_DYNAMO_DEBUG=1`.

## Simple Benchmarking

for how to benchmark a PyTorch/XLA model.

## Known Performance Caveats

PyTorch/XLA behaves semantically like regular PyTorch and XLA tensors
share the full tensor interface with CPU & GPU tensors. However,
constraints in XLA/hardware and the lazy evaluation model suggest
certain patterns might result in bad performance.

If your model shows bad performance, keep in mind the following caveats:

1.  **XLA/TPU yield degraded performance with too many recompilations.**

    XLA compilation is expensive. PyTorch/XLA automatically recompiles
    the graph every time new shapes are encountered. Usually models
    should stabilize within a few steps and you can see huge speedup for
    the rest of training.

    In order to avoid recompilations, not only must shapes be constant,
    but computations across XLA devices in all hosts should also be
    constant.

    *Possible sources*:

    -   Direct or indirect uses of `nonzero` introduce dynamic shapes;
        for example, masked indexing `base[index]` where `index` is a
        mask tensor.
    -   Loops with a different number of iterations between steps can
        result in different execution graphs, thus require
        recompilations.

    *Solution*:

    -   Tensor shapes should be the same between iterations, or a low
        number of shape variations should be used.
    -   Pad tensors to fixed sizes when possible.

2.  **Certain operations don't have native translations to XLA.**

    For these operations PyTorch/XLA automatically transfers to the CPU
    memory, evaluates on CPU, and transfers the result back to the XLA
    device. Doing too many such operations during the training step can
    lead to significant slowdowns.

    *Possible sources*:

    -   The `item()` operation explicitly asks to evaluate the result.
        Don't use it unless it's necessary.

    *Solution*:

    -   For most ops we can lower them to XLA to fix it. Checkout
        [metrics report section](#metrics-report) to find out the
        missing ops and open a feature request on
        [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/issues).

    -   Even when a PyTorch tensor is known as a scalar, avoid using
        tensor.item()\`. Keep it as a tensor and use tensor operations
        on it.

    -   Use `torch.where` to substitute control flow when applicable.
        E.g. The control flow with `item()` used in
        [clip_grad_norm](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/de19eeee99a2a282fc441f637b23d8e50c75ecd1/torch/nn/utils/clip_grad.py#L33)
        is problematic and impacts performance, so we have
        [patched](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/torch_patches/X10-clip_grad.diff)
        `clip_grad_norm_` by calling `torch.where` instead, which gives
        us a dramatic performance improvement.

        ``` python
        ...
        else:
          device = parameters[0].device
          total_norm = torch.zeros([], device=device if parameters else None)
          for p in parameters:
            param_norm = p.grad.data.norm(norm_type) ** norm_type
            total_norm.add_(param_norm)
          total_norm = (total_norm ** (1. / norm_type))
        clip_coef = torch.tensor(max_norm, device=device) / (total_norm + 1e-6)
        for p in parameters:
          p.grad.data.mul_(torch.where(clip_coef < 1, clip_coef, torch.tensor(1., device=device)))
        ```

3.  **Iterators in \`\`torch_xla.distributed.data_parallel\`\` may drop
    the last few batches in the input iterator.**

    This is to make sure we do the same amount of work on all XLA
    devices.

    *Solution*:

    -   When dataset is small, and there are too few steps, this may
        result in a no-op epoch. Therefore, it is better to use small
        batch sizes in those cases.

## XLA Tensor Quirks

1.  **XLA tensor internals are opaque.** XLA tensors always appear to be
    contiguous and without storage. Networks should not try to check the
    strides of XLA tensors.
2.  **XLA tensors should be moved to the CPU before saving them.**
    Saving XLA tensors directly causes them to be loaded back on the
    device(s) they were saved from. If a device is unavailable at load
    time then the load will fail. Moving XLA tensors to the CPU before
    saving them lets you decide which device(s) to put the loaded
    tensors on. This is necessary if you want to load the tensors on a
    machine without XLA devices. Care should be taken moving the XLA
    tensors to the CPU before saving them, however, as moving tensors
    across device types does not preserve view relationships. Instead,
    views should be reconstructed as necessary after the tensors are
    loaded.
3.  **Copying an XLA Tensor with Python's copy.copy returns a deep copy,
    not a shallow copy.** Use a view of an XLA tensor to get a shallow
    copy of it.
4.  **Handling shared weights.** Modules can share weights by setting
    the Parameters of one module to another. This "tying" of module
    weights should be done **AFTER** the modules are moved to an XLA
    device. Otherwise two independent copies of the shared tensor will
    be made on the XLA device.

## More Debugging Tools

We don't expect users to use tools in this section to debug their
models. But we might ask for them when you submit a bug report since
they provide additional information that metrics report doesn't have.

-   `print(torch_xla._XLAC._get_xla_tensors_text([res]))` where `res` is
    the result tensor prints out the IR.
-   `print(torch_xla._XLAC._get_xla_tensors_hlo([res]))` where `res` is
    the result tensor prints out the generated XLA HLO.

Note these functions must be called prior to `mark_step()`, otherwise
the tensor will already be materialized.

### Environment Variables

There are also a number of environment variables which control the
behavior of the *PyTorch/XLA* software stack.

Setting such variables will cause different degrees of performance
degradation, so they should only be enabled for debugging.

-   `XLA_IR_DEBUG`: Enables the *Python* stack trace to be captured
    where creating IR nodes, hence allowing to understand which
    *PyTorch* operation was responsible for generating the IR.
-   `XLA_HLO_DEBUG`: Enables the *Python* stack frame captured when
    *XLA_IR_DEBUG* is active, to be propagated to the *XLA* *HLO*
    metadata.
-   `XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FILE`: The path to a file which will be used to
    dump the IR graphs during execution. Note that the file can become
    really big if the option is left enabled and the *PyTorch* program
    let run for long time. The graphs are appended to the file, so to
    have a clean sheet from run to run, the file should be explicitly
    removed.
-   `XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FMT`: The format of the graphs stored within the
    *XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FILE* file. Can be `text` (the default), `dot`
    (the *Graphviz* format) or `hlo`.
-   `XLA_FLAGS=--xla_dump_to`: If set to `=/tmp/dir_name`, XLA compiler
    will dump the unoptimized and optimzed HLO per compilation.
-   `XLA_METRICS_FILE`: If set, the path to a local file where the
    internal metrics will be saved at every step. Metrics will be
    appended to the file, if already existing.
-   `XLA_SAVE_HLO_FILE`: If set, the path to a local file where, in case
    of compilation/execution error, the offending HLO graph will be
    saved.
-   `XLA_SYNC_WAIT`: Forces the XLA tensor sync operation to wait for
    its completion, before moving to the next step.
-   `XLA_USE_EAGER_DEBUG_MODE`: Forces the XLA tensor to execute
    eagerly, meaning compile and execute the torch operations one by
    one. This is useful to bypass the long compilation time but overall
    step time will be a lot slower and memory usage will be higher since
    all compiler optimizaiton will be skipped.
-   `TF_CPP_LOG_THREAD_ID`: If set to 1, the TF logs will show the
    thread ID helping with debugging multithreaded processes.
-   `TF_CPP_VMODULE`: Environment variable used for TF VLOGs and takes
    the form of `TF_CPP_VMODULE=name=value,...`. Note that for VLOGs you
    must set `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0`.
-   `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`: Level to print messages for.
    `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0` will turn on INFO logging,
    `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=1` WARNING and so on. Our PyTorch/XLA
    `TF_VLOG` uses `tensorflow::INFO` level by default so to see VLOGs
    set `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0`.
-   `XLA_DUMP_HLO_GRAPH`: If set to `=1` in case of a compilation or
    execution error the offending HLO graph will be dumped as part of
    the runtime error raised by `xla_util.cc`.

### Common Debugging Environment Variables Combinations

-   Record the graph execution in the IR format

        XLA_IR_DEBUG=1 XLA_HLO_DEBUG=1 XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FMT="text" XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FILE="/tmp/save1.ir"  

-   Record the graph execution in the HLO format

        XLA_IR_DEBUG=1 XLA_HLO_DEBUG=1 XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FMT="hlo" XLA_SAVE_TENSORS_FILE="/tmp/save1.hlo"

-   Show debugging VLOG for runtime and graph compilation/execution

        TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0 TF_CPP_VMODULE="xla_graph_executor=5,pjrt_computation_client=3"

### Reproducing PyTorch/XLA CI/CD unit test failures.

You may see some test failures for a PR such as:

To execute this test, run the following from the base repo dir:

```bash
PYTORCH_TEST_WITH_SLOW=1 python ../test/test_torch.py -k test_put_xla_uint8
```

Running this directly in the command line does not work. You need to set
the environment variable `TORCH_TEST_DEVICES` to your local
`pytorch/xla/test/pytorch_test_base.py`. For example:

```bash
TORCH_TEST_DEVICES=/path/to/pytorch/xla/test/pytorch_test_base.py PYTORCH_TEST_WITH_SLOW=1 python ../test/test_torch.py -k test_put_xla_uint8
```
should work.
