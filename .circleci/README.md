# CircleCI Overview
PyTorch and PyTorch/XLA use CircleCI to lint, build, and test each PR that is submitted. All CircleCI tests should succeed before the PR is merged into master. PyTorch CircleCI pins PyTorch/XLA to a specific commit. On the other hand, PyTorch/XLA CircleCI pulls PyTorch from master unless a pin is manually provided. This README will go through the reasons of these pins, how to pin a PyTorch/XLA PR to an upstream PyTorch PR, and how to coordinate a merge for breaking PyTorch changes.

## Why does PyTorch CircleCI pin PyTorch/XLA?
As mentioned above, [PyTorch CircleCI pins PyTorch/XLA](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/.jenkins/pytorch/common_utils.sh#L119) to a "known good" commit to prevent accidental changes from PyTorch/XLA to break PyTorch CircleCI without warning. PyTorch has hundreds of commits each week, and this pin ensures that PyTorch/XLA as a downstream package does not cause failures in PyTorch CircleCI. 

## Why does PyTorch/XLA CircleCI pull from PyTorch master?
[PyTorch/XLA CircleCI pulls PyTorch from master](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/f3415929683880192b63b285921c72439af55bf0/.circleci/common.sh#L15) unless a PyTorch pin is manually provided. PyTorch/XLA is a downstream package to PyTorch, and pulling from master ensures that PyTorch/XLA will stay up-to-date and works with the latest PyTorch changes.

## Pinning PyTorch PR in PyTorch/XLA PR
Sometimes a PyTorch/XLA PR needs to be pinned to a specific PyTorch PR to test new featurues, fix breaking changes, etc. Since PyTorch/XLA CircleCI pulls from PyTorch master by default, we need to manually provided a PyTorch pin. In a PyTorch/XLA PR, PyTorch an be manually pinned by creating a `.torch_pin` under `/torch_patches`. The `.torch_pin` should have the corresponding PyTorch PR number prefixed by "#". Take a look at [example here](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/pull/3792/commits/40f41fb98b0f2386d287eeac0bae86e873d4a9d8). Before the PyTorch/XLA PR gets merged, the `.torch_pin` must be deleted. 

## Coodinating merges for breaking PyTorch PRs
When PyTorch PR introduces a breaking change, its PyTorch/XLA CircleCI tests will fail. Steps for fixing and merging such breaking PyTorch change is as following: 
1. Create a PyTorch/XLA PR to fix this issue with `.torch_pin` and rebase with master to ensure the PR is up-to-date with the latest commit on PyTorch/XLA. Once this PR is created, it'll create a commit hash that will be used in step 2. If you have multiple commits in the PR, use the last one's hash.
2. Rebase (or ask the PR owner to rebase) the PyTorch PR with master. Update the PyTorch PR to pin the PyTorch/XLA to the commit hash created in step 1 by updating `pytorch/.github/ci_commit_pins/xla.txt`.
3. Once CircleCI tests are green on both ends, merge PyTorch PR.
4. Remove the `.torch_pin` in PyTorch/XLA PR and merge. To be noted, `git commit --amend` should be avoided in this step as PyTorch CI will keep using the commit hash created in step 1 until other PRs update that manually or the nightly buildbot updates that automatically.
5. Finally, don't delete your branch until 2 days later. See step 4 for explanations.
