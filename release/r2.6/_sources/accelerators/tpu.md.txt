# Learn about TPUs

Google Cloud TPUs are custom-designed AI accelerators, which are
optimized for training and inference of large AI models. They are ideal
for a variety of use cases, such as chatbots, code generation, media
content generation, synthetic speech, vision services, recommendation
engines, personalization models, among others.

Cloud TPUs are designed to scale cost-efficiently for a wide range of AI
workloads, spanning training, fine-tuning, and inference. Cloud TPUs
provide the versatility to accelerate workloads on leading AI
frameworks, including PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow. Seamlessly
orchestrate large-scale AI workloads through Cloud TPU integration in
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Leverage Dynamic Workload Scheduler to
improve the scalability of workloads by scheduling all accelerators
needed simultaneously. Customers looking for the simplest way to develop
AI models can also leverage Cloud TPUs in Vertex AI, a fully-managed AI
platform.
