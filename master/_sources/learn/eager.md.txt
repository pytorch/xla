# Eager Mode + Compile API

In this doc we will go over how to use PyTorch/XLA's new experimental
`eager` mode with the `compile` API. The goal is to make PyTorch/XLA
experience more aligned with the native PyTorch and make development
process easier.

Currently PyTorch/XLA runs on the LazyTensor tracing mode by default. In
the following code

``` python
import torch
import torch_xla
import torchvision

device = torch_xla.device()
model = torchvision.models.resnet18().to(device)
input = torch.randn(64, 3, 224, 224).to(device)

# model tracing
res = model(input)

# model execution, same as `xm.mark_step`
torch_xla.sync()
```

The actual model compilation and device execution happens when
`torch_xla.sync` is called. There are multiple drawback of this
approach.

1.  Users are often confused about when the framework is tracing and
    when the framework is executing.
2.  Non-core model code(data preprocessing for example) often generates
    some small pending execution that gets leaked into the main
    graph(step function) and causes recompilation. The recompilation of
    the whole graph is usually very expensive.
3.  It is hard to debug when/why recompilation happens.

To mitigate above issues we want to introduce the new UX with eager and
compile.

## Basic Usage

``` python
import torch
import torch_xla
import torchvision

# Run ops eagerly by default
torch_xla.experimental.eager_mode(True)

device = torch_xla.device()
model = torchvision.models.resnet18().to(device)

# Mark the function to be compiled
compiled_model = torch_xla.compile(model)
input = torch.randn(64, 3, 224, 224).to(device)

# Compilation and execution happens right away.
res = compiled_model(input)
```

Note that

1.  Currently user has to manually enable the eager mode by
    `torch_xla.experimental.eager_mode(True)`.
2.  The region of the code that wants to be compiled should be wrapped
    by `torch_xla.compile`.

The implementation of the `torch_xla.compile` is actually pretty
straight forward, it disable the eager mode when entering the target
function and start tracing. It will call the `torch_xla.sync()` when
target function returns and reenable the eager mode. You can expect the
same perfomrance by using the `eager` + `compile` API compared to the
existing `mark_step/sync` approach.

### Inference

``` python
torch_xla.experimental.eager_mode(True)
compiled_model = torch.compile(model, backend="openxla")
```

It is recommened to use the `torch.compile` instead of
`torch_xla.compile` for inference to reduce the tracing overhad.

### Training

``` python
torch_xla.experimental.eager_mode(True)

def step_fn(model, data, target, loss_fn, optimizer):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    logits = model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(logits, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return loss

step_fn = torch_xla.compile(step_fn)
```

In training we asked user to refactor the `step_fn` out because it is
usually better to compile the model's forward, backward and optimizer
together. The long term goal is to also use `torch.compile` for training
but right now we recommend user to use `torch_xla.compile`(for
perfomrance reason).

## Benchmark

I run a 2 layer decoder only model training(it is pretty much just a
llama2) with fake data on a single chip of v4-8 for 300 steps. Below is
the number I observed.

  Mode                        token/s
  --------------------------- ---------
  Tracing mode (base line)    147
  Eager mode                  65
  Eager + torch_xla compile   147

  : Eager mode benchmarks

Eager mode can achieve ~45% performance of the fully compiled model for
the decoder only model. For more information, see 
[train_decoder_only_base.py](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/examples/train_decoder_only_base.py)
and [eager example](https://github.com/pytorch/xla/tree/master/examples/eager).
Note that perfomrane of the eager mode is very model dependent. When I
tried to run the resnet50, the eager mode perfomrance is \~1% of the
compiled mode. We don't exepct user to use eager mode to execute the
main training loop. Eager mode is meant to be used to handle non-core
part of the training/inference logic(Data preprocessing, random number
generations etc) or debug.
