# Terraform

This file contains instructions for common Terraform operations.

## Install Terraform

Make sure that a recent Terraform binary is installed (>= 1.3.8). If not,
install Terraform from the
[official source](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

## First time initialization

1. Run `gcloud auth application-default login` on your local workstation.
1. Go to the directory of the desired Terraform setup, for example
   [`tpu-pytorch-releases`](./tpu-pytorch-releases).
1. Run `terraform init`.
1. (Optional) Consider installing
   [Terraform extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HashiCorp.terraform).

## Preview Terraform changes

1. See [First time initialization](#first-time-initialization).
1. Run `terraform plan`

Terraform will print proposed changes.

## Enforce entire Terraform setup manually

Both GCP projects contain `terraform-provision-trigger` that will automatically
enforce new Terraform setup on every push to the `master` branch. Follow the
steps below if for any reason you need to apply Terraform setup manually.

1. See [First time initialization](#first-time-initialization).
1. Run `terraform apply`. Preview the planned changes. If you added an instance
   of new module you may need to run `terraform init` (it's safe to run `init`
   multiple times).
1. Confirm planned changes by typing "yes" and pressing enter.
1. Wait for Terraform to finish provisioning resources.

## Enforce only selected resources

1. Run `terraform apply` to preview planned changes.
1. Take a note of the Terraform's resource ID that you want to provision.

**Example**

For the following Terraform plan:

```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.bazel_builds.module.cloud_build.google_cloudbuild_trigger.trigger will be destroyed
  # (because google_cloudbuild_trigger.trigger is not in configuration)
  - resource "google_cloudbuild_trigger" "trigger" {
      - create_time        = "2023-04-13T10:52:58.971939642Z" -> null

 ...
```

`module.bazel_builds.module.cloud_build.google_cloudbuild_trigger.trigger` is a
resource ID.

3. Run `terraform apply -target=$RESOURCE_ID`. Verify that only the desired
   resource will be modified. The flag can be used multiple times, also with
   `terraform destroy` command.

## Check if Terraform setup is fully provisioned

1. Running `terraform plan` should return an empty plan if the local
   configuration was fully provisioned. Terraform won't show diff in any
   resources that were not created by Terraform.
